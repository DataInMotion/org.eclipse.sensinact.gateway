# What's new?

Since 2022, contributors are working together to prepare the new version of Eclipse sensiNact.

The new version, numbered 0.0.2, changed the threading and interaction models while keeping the core data model.

The legacy sensiNact studio is not supported anymore.
It will be replaced by a Web UI in a future release.

Currently, the sensiNact applications are not supported, they will be added back in a future release.
