A general issue with this tests might be, that all tests share the same sqlite DB.

# TestSecurity

This isn't really testing anything  besides the providers being empty. It only prints things out.

# Additional Tests that are failing and are disabled

* org.eclipse.sensinact.gateway.core.security.test.TestDAO#testSelectObjectDAO
* org.eclipse.sensinact.gateway.core.security.test.TestSecurity
* org.eclipse.sensinact.gateway.core.security.test.TestSecurityPattern
* org.eclipse.sensinact.gateway.core.security.test.TestUserManager


No clue what is going wrong here.
