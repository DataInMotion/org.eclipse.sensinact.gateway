# The Eclipse sensiNact gateway upgrade

This branch represents the ongoing work to rebuild the core of sensiNact in an effort to improve integration with other Eclipse projects, and to modernise the codebase as a whole.

## The legacy folder

This folder contains the whole of the sensiNact 2.0-SNAPSHOT build, and represents the branch point from which this prototype will continue

## The prototype folder

This folder contains the new core of the gateway, and will be slowly expanded to encompass the full set of existing use cases
